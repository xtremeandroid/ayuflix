# Simple Movie Website Made using React (uses OMDB API)
The Simple Movie Website is a user-friendly application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website utilizes the OMDB API, which provides access to a vast database of movies, including their details and posters.

The primary function of this movie website is to allow users to search for their favorite movies. Users can enter the title of a movie in the search bar, and the website will make a request to the OMDB API to retrieve relevant movie results. The results are then displayed in an organized manner, showing the movie title, year of release, and a poster thumbnail.

One of the key features of this website is that users can click on a movie poster to be redirected to the corresponding IMDb page for that movie. By clicking on the poster, users can access additional information about the movie, including its rating, cast, plot, and reviews.

The design of the Simple Movie Website is clean and minimalistic, with a focus on providing a seamless user experience. The search bar is prominently placed at the top of the page, allowing users to quickly find the movies they are looking for. The movie results are presented in a visually appealing grid layout, making it easy for users to browse through the available options.

Overall, the Simple Movie Website is an efficient and straightforward application that leverages React and the OMDB API to provide users with a convenient platform for searching movies. Whether you're looking for information about a specific movie or want to explore new titles, this website offers a streamlined experience, ensuring that movie enthusiasts can find the information they need quickly and effortlessly.
